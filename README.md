# Flask-portfolio
Basic  porfolio app using flask
This was just me trying to understand how I could do basic routing , database queries using the Flask microframework. In order to understand that I basically made a basic app where the user can create their own portfolio. So the user will be able to enter some of their info such as bio, projects ,email address to create their own profile. When the user logins into the profile they can view and update their personal info . Also the user will be able to update their personal info.
